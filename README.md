# MediaPlayer
simple media player app that uses navigation library to navigation between list of favouriteSong
,data binding to replace to replace boilerplate code of find view by id with binding views in xml at compile time
,Exo player library to handle playing audio file 
,forground service so audio still plays even if user close the app 
,notification controller for audio file that contact with service so it makes easy to controll the audio without even open the app
,the app at this stage has poor ui beacuse all what i am intersted about at this stage is the logic
